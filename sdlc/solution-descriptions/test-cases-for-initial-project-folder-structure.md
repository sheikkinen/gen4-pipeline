# Solution Description: Test Cases for Initial Project Folder Structure

## Overview
To ensure the initial project folder structure is correct and well-documented, we will define test cases that verify the presence and organization of all required files and folders.

## Steps
1. List all required files and directories as per the user story and documentation.
2. Define manual or automated test cases to check for:
    - Existence of `hidream-replicate.mjs` in the root
    - Existence of `samples/`, `src/`, and `sdlc/` directories
    - Existence of `architecture.md`, `vision.md`, `backlog.md`, `user-stories/`, and `solution-descriptions/` inside `sdlc/`
    - Accuracy of documentation in `README.md` and `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
3. Document the test cases in a markdown file for review and future automation.

## Rationale
Testing the folder structure ensures consistency, supports onboarding, and prevents missing documentation or code organization issues.

## Alignment
- **Architecture**: Ensures the project structure supports modularity and maintainability.
- **Vision**: Supports transparency and ease of collaboration from the start.

## Acceptance Criteria Mapping
- All required files and folders are present and correctly named.
- Documentation matches the actual structure.
- Test cases are documented and reviewable.
