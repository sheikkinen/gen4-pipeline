# Solution Description: Update gen4 Image Generator Script Using hidream-replicate.mjs

## Overview
To improve the stand-alone gen4 image generator script, we will review and incorporate relevant logic, structure, or enhancements from `samples/hidream-replicate.mjs`.

## Steps
1. Review the code in `samples/hidream-replicate.mjs` for reusable logic, error handling, or best practices.
2. Update `src/gen4-image-generator.mjs` to incorporate:
    - Improved API usage
    - Enhanced error handling
    - Better parameterization or CLI support
    - Any other relevant improvements
3. Test the updated script to ensure it remains functional and produces the expected output.
4. Update documentation and usage instructions as needed.

## Rationale
Leveraging improvements from sample scripts ensures consistency, maintainability, and best practices across the codebase.

## Alignment
- **Architecture**: Promotes code reuse and maintainability.
- **Vision**: Ensures robust, user-friendly tooling for image generation.

## Acceptance Criteria Mapping
- Script is updated and improved
- Functionality is verified
- Documentation is current
