# Solution Description: Stand-alone Script for Image Generation using gen4

## Overview
To fulfill the user story, a stand-alone script will be created in the `samples/` directory. This script will use gen4 to generate images, following the structure and logic of existing sample scripts, but designed to be run independently.

## Steps
1. Review existing sample scripts in the `samples/` directory for reference and reusable code.
2. Create a new script (e.g., `samples/gen4-image-generator.mjs`) that:
    - Imports and initializes gen4
    - Accepts input parameters (e.g., prompt, output path) via command-line arguments or hardcoded defaults
    - Generates one or more images using gen4
    - Saves the generated images to the specified output location
    - Includes usage instructions in comments or accompanying documentation
3. Test the script to ensure it works with minimal setup and produces the expected output images.
4. Update documentation to reference the new script and provide usage examples.

## Rationale
A stand-alone script makes it easy for users and developers to quickly generate images for testing, demos, or experimentation, without needing to run the full pipeline.

## Alignment
- **Architecture**: The script is modular and does not require changes to the core pipeline.
- **Vision**: Supports accessibility, experimentation, and rapid prototyping.

## Acceptance Criteria Mapping
- Script exists and is executable
- Script uses gen4 to generate images
- Instructions are clear and included
- Output images are produced as expected
