# Solution Description: Scene Generation Script

## Overview
To automate scene creation for Visual Novels, we will implement `generate-scenes.mjs`, which generates composite scene images using references to character and background images.

## Technical Approach
- The script will accept a prompt, references to character and background images, and an output path (defaulting to `scenes/`).
- The script will use the gen4 pipeline to generate images.
- The output folder will be created if it does not exist.
- Usage will be documented in the plan.

## Alignment
- This solution supports modular, organized scene generation for creative projects.
