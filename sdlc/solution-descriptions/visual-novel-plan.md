# Solution Description: Visual Novel Image Generation Plan

## Overview
To support Visual Novel development, we will draft a plan and design scripts for generating and organizing character, background, and scene images using the gen4 pipeline. This will streamline asset creation and ensure assets are organized for easy use in VN engines.

## Technical Approach
- **Folder Structure:**
  - `/characters/` for generated character images
  - `/backgrounds/` for generated background images
  - `/scenes/` for composite/generated scene images
- **Scripts:**
  - `generate-characters.mjs`: Generates character images based on prompts and saves them to `/characters/`.
  - `generate-backgrounds.mjs`: Generates background images based on prompts and saves them to `/backgrounds/`.
  - `generate-scenes.mjs`: Generates scenes using references to character and background images, saving results to `/scenes/`.
- **Plan Document:**
  - A markdown file in `doc/` outlining the workflow, prompts, and usage examples.
- **Implementation Details:**
  - Scripts will use the existing gen4 pipeline and support CLI arguments for prompts, references, and output folders.
  - Folder creation and organization will be automated.

## Alignment
- This plan supports the project vision of enabling rapid, organized asset generation for creative projects.
- The approach is modular and extensible.

## Next Steps
- Draft the plan in `doc/visual-novel-plan.md`.
- Implement and test the scripts as described.
