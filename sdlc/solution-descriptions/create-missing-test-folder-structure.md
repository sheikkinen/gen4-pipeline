# Solution Description: Create Missing Test Folder Structure

## Overview
To support organized and maintainable testing, a `test/` directory will be created at the project root. This directory will house all future test scripts and related files.

## Steps
1. Create a `test/` directory at the root of the project.
2. Optionally, add a placeholder test file (e.g., `test/example.test.js`) to demonstrate usage.
3. Update the project `README.md` and SDLC instructions to include the new `test/` directory in the documented folder structure.

## Rationale
A dedicated test folder ensures that all tests are easy to locate and maintain, supporting best practices in software development and quality assurance.

## Alignment
- **Architecture**: Supports modularity and separation of concerns.
- **Vision**: Promotes maintainability and robust testing.

## Acceptance Criteria Mapping
- `test/` directory exists
- Folder structure documentation is updated
- Example or placeholder test file is present (if appropriate)
