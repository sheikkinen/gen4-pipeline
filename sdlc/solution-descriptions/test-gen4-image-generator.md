# Solution Description: Test Stand-alone gen4 Image Generator Script

## Overview
After moving the gen4 image generator script to the `src/` directory, it should be tested to ensure it still works as intended.

## Steps
1. Ensure all dependencies (e.g., Replicate API, Node.js) are available.
2. Set the required environment variable (`REPLICATE_API_TOKEN`).
3. Run the script from its new location: `node src/gen4-image-generator.mjs`.
4. Verify that the script generates images as expected and outputs the correct information.
5. Update documentation if any changes are needed for usage or setup.

## Rationale
Testing after moving code ensures that no path or environment issues have been introduced and that the script remains functional.

## Alignment
- **Architecture**: Ensures code organization changes do not break functionality.
- **Vision**: Maintains reliability and usability for contributors and users.

## Acceptance Criteria Mapping
- Script runs and generates images
- Documentation is accurate
- No errors or regressions after the move
