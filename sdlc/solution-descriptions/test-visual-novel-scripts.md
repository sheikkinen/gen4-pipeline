# Solution Description: Test Cases for Visual Novel Generation Scripts

## Overview
To ensure reliability, we will implement Jest tests for the character, background, and scene generation scripts. These tests will verify that each script creates the output folder, generates an image, and writes the correct metadata.

## Technical Approach
- Use Jest to run each script via `child_process.exec`.
- Provide a test prompt and output path for each script.
- After execution, check that the output file exists and contains the expected metadata.
- Clean up test outputs as needed.

## Alignment
- This approach ensures the scripts are robust and maintainable, supporting the project's quality goals.
