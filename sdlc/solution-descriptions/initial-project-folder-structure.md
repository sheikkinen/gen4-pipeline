# Solution Description: Initial Project Folder Structure

## Overview
To fulfill the user story for an organized initial project folder structure, the following approach will be taken:

## Steps
1. Create the root-level main script file (`hidream-replicate.mjs`).
2. Create the `sdlc/` directory to house all SDLC-related documentation and subfolders.
3. Create the `samples/` directory for example data, scripts, or reference files.
4. Create the `src/` directory for source code implementation.
5. Inside `sdlc/`, create:
    - `architecture.md` for system architecture documentation
    - `vision.md` for project vision and goals
    - `backlog.md` for the task list
    - `user-stories/` folder for user stories
    - `solution-descriptions/` folder for solution descriptions
6. Document the folder structure in both the project `README.md` and `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for clarity and onboarding.



## Rationale
This structure ensures that all SDLC documentation is centralized, easy to find, and supports traceability from backlog to implementation. It also provides a clear starting point for new contributors.

## Alignment
- **Architecture**: The structure supports modular growth and clear separation of concerns.
- **Vision**: Aligns with the goal of maintainability and transparency in the development process.

## Acceptance Criteria Mapping
- All required files and folders are present as described in the user story.
- Documentation is updated to reflect the structure.
