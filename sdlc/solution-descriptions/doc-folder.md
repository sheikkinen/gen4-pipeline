# Solution Description: Documentation Folder

## Overview
To improve project organization, a `doc/` folder will be created at the root of the repository. This folder will hold all documentation files that are not part of the SDLC process (which remain in `sdlc/`).

## Technical Approach
- Create a `doc/` directory at the project root.
- Place general documentation, guides, and reference material in this folder.
- Update the architecture documentation to reflect this addition.

## Alignment
- This solution aligns with the project's vision of maintainability and clarity.
- It does not impact the codebase or require testing.
