# User Story: Character and Background Generation Script

## Title
As a developer, I want scripts to generate character and background images for a Visual Novel using gen4, so that I can efficiently create and organize these assets in dedicated folders.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A script exists to generate character images from prompts and save them to a `characters/` folder.
- A script exists to generate background images from prompts and save them to a `backgrounds/` folder.
- The scripts create the output folders if they do not exist.
- Usage is documented in the plan.
