# User Story: Stand-alone Script for Image Generation using gen4

## As a
User or developer

## I want to
Have a stand-alone script that generates images using gen4, based on provided sample scripts

## So that
I can easily generate images without needing to run the full pipeline or additional dependencies, making testing and experimentation straightforward.

### Acceptance Criteria
- A script exists (e.g., `samples/gen4-image-generator.mjs`) that can be run independently
- The script uses gen4 to generate images
- The script is based on or inspired by existing sample scripts
- Usage instructions are included in the script or accompanying documentation
- The script works with minimal setup and produces output images as expected
