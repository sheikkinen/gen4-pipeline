# User Story: Scene Generation Script

## Title
As a developer, I want a script to generate scene images for a Visual Novel using gen4, combining character and background images, so that I can efficiently create composite scenes for my project.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A script exists to generate scene images using references to character and background images, saving results to a `scenes/` folder.
- The script creates the output folder if it does not exist.
- Usage is documented in the plan.
