# User Story: Test Cases for Initial Project Folder Structure

## As a
Developer or reviewer

## I want to
Have test cases that verify the presence and correctness of the initial project folder structure

## So that
I can ensure the project starts with a well-defined, documented, and consistent structure, making onboarding and collaboration easier.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Automated or manual test cases exist to check:
  - The presence of `hidream-replicate.mjs` in the root
  - The presence of `samples/`, `src/`, and `sdlc/` directories
  - The presence of required files and folders inside `sdlc/` (`architecture.md`, `vision.md`, `backlog.md`, `user-stories/`, `solution-descriptions/`)
  - Documentation files (`README.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`) accurately reflect the structure
- Tests are documented and can be executed or reviewed by others
