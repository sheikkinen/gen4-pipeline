# User Story: Support CLI Arguments for Prompt, Mode, and Output

## As a
User or developer

## I want to
Run the gen4 image generator script with command-line arguments for prompt, mode (e.g., fast, normal, dev), and output path

## So that
I can flexibly generate images with different settings and save them to custom locations without editing the script

### Acceptance Criteria
- The script accepts CLI arguments for prompt, mode, and output path
- Usage instructions are included in the script or documentation
- The script works as expected with different argument combinations
