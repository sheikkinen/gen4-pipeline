# User Story: Initial Project Folder Structure

## As a
Developer or project maintainer

## I want to
Have a clear and organized initial folder structure for the project

## So that
All team members can easily navigate, understand, and contribute to the project, and SDLC documentation is well-structured from the start.

### Acceptance Criteria
- The root folder contains a main script file and an `sdlc/` directory.
- The `sdlc/` directory contains:
  - `architecture.md` for system architecture
  - `vision.md` for project vision and goals
  - `backlog.md` for the task list
  - `user-stories/` for user stories
  - `solution-descriptions/` for solution descriptions
- The structure is documented in the project README and SDLC instructions.
