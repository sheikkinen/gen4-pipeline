# User Story: Documentation Folder

## Title
As a developer, I want a dedicated `doc/` folder to hold documentation files, so that project documentation is organized and easy to find.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A `doc/` folder exists at the project root.
- Documentation files (e.g., guides, API docs, usage notes) can be placed in this folder.
- The folder is referenced in the architecture documentation.
